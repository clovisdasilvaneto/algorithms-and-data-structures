## What to look out

- Check if there will be any duplicated values in the array. If so, will the presence of them affect the answer? Does it makes the question simpler?
- Watch out to not go out of bounds when using an index to iterate through the array elements
- Be careful when using slicing or concat arrays in your code! Typically they take O(n) time. Try to use start and end indices to demarcate a subarray where it is possible.
